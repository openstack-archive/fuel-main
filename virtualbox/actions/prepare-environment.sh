# This script performs initial check and configuration of the host system. It:
#   - verifies that all available command-line tools are present on the host system
#   - check that there is no previous installation of Fuel Web (if there is one, the script deletes it)
#   - creates host-only network interfaces
#
# We are avoiding using 'which' because of http://stackoverflow.com/questions/592620/check-if-a-program-exists-from-a-bash-script
