In order to successfully run Fuel Web under VirtualBox, you need to:
- download the official release (.iso) and place it under 'iso' directory
- run "./launch.sh". it will automatically pick up the iso, and will spin up master node and slave nodes

If there are any errors, the script will report them and abort.

If you want to change settings (number of OpenStack nodes, CPU, RAM, HDD), please refer to "config.sh".
